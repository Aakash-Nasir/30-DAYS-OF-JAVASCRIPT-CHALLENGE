Day 17. Data Structures

Feature Request
Linked List Script: Write a script that implements a linked list with methods to add, remove, and display nodes.
Stack Script: Create a script that implements a stack and uses it to reverse a string.
Queue Script: Write a script that implements a queue and simulates a printer queue.
Binary Tree Script: Create a script that implements a binary tree with insertion and in-order traversal methods.
Graph Script: Write a script that implements a graph and performs breadth-first search (optional).
Achievements
By the end of these activities, students will:

Implement and use linked lists for dynamic data storage.
Use stacks for LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) operations and reverse data.
Use queues for FIFO (First-In-First-Out) operations and simulate real-world scenarios.
Implement binary trees for hierarchical data storage and traversal.
Understand and use graphs for network representations and pathfinding (optional).
